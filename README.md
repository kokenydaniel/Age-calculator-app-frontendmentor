## About The Project

Also a smaller project from frontendmentor.io, where an age calculator had to be created responsively.

## Built in

1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Flex


## What I learned

It helped me understand javascript date handling a bit better. I think this is one of the hardest parts. I like to do similar smaller projects because it helps me practice responsive implementation and practicing javascript subpages even better.

## Acknowledgment

Thanks to everyone who gives feedback on my solution. It definitely helps you find new ways to code and find easier solutions!
